/*
 * Ex about Cartesian Product: when we SELECT table from two other tables,
 * SELEC merge every row of first table with every row of second one
 *
 * In this case it's possible to write just 'SELECT *' which just take all
 * rows from 'person' and 'pizzeria', but then there will be default names
 * of columns in resultin table
 *
 *
 * Possible to do just with two tables in from as:
 * 		 ___________________________________________________________________________________________
 * 		| select																					|
 * 		| 	person.id as "person.id", person.name as "person.name", person.age as "age",			|
 * 		| 	person.gender as "gender", person.address as "address", pizzeria.id as "pizzeria.id",	|
 * 		| 	pizzeria.name as "pizzeria.name", pizzeria.rating as "rating"							|
 * 		| from person, pizzeria																		|
 * 		| order by person.id, pizzeria.id															|
 * 		 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 */

select *
from person
	cross join pizzeria
order by person.id, pizzeria.id;
